# Basic ideas and concepts

- Start with HDX-MS data in a QFeatures object and perform statistical workflows and visualisation. 


# Installation requirements

Users will require a working version of R, currently at least version >4. It is recommend to use RStudio. The package can then be installed using the `devtools` package. The package should take a few minutes to install on a regular desktop or laptop. The package will need to be loaded using `library(hdxstats)`

```{r,}
devtools::install_github("ococrook/hdxstats")
```
